<h2>Initial Plan:</h2>
<p>The idea of being able to externally share your playlist of favorite videos was something I thought was a great start.
So I thought lets make a VidMe library. A hosted api site that saves your username and library of favorite URL's of videos from various sites.</p>

<h2>Sprint 1:</h2>
<h4>Get a Wireframe and ERD diagram proposed to follow up on initial start up of the fullstack project.</h4>

<h2>Sprint 2:</h2>
<h4>Set up backend to have dependencies and application properties set up properly.</h4>

<h2>Sprint 3:</h2>
<h4>Full operational Backend API that can add users, register new users, have users add to list with titles and url links, and be able to delete their items.</h4>

<h2>Sprint 4:</h2>
<h4>Implement edits and text changes to service and controller call for backend. Push backend to heroku for proper server usage.</h4>

<h2>Sprint 5:</h2>
<h4>Extrapolate the process to how we want the Front to work. Attempting a forum based website that lets you see yours and others vid items</h4>

<h2>Sprint 6:</h2>
<h4>Set up backend heroku to connect with userservice and vidmelibraryservice. Also add methods to take objects and display the username email password etc in sign up and login</h4>

<h2>Sprint: 7:</h2>
<h4>Have vidmelibrary display item boxes that show user and their title and url link</h4>

<h2>Sprint 8:</h2>
<h4>Work on CSS and routing for all pages in the app</h4>

<h2>Sprint 9:</h2>
<h4>Make adjustments and final visual editsfor pages and make ts code efficient</h4>

<h2>Final Sprint</h2>
<h4>Push final code to heroku and have a proper app. Adjust package.json and dependencies to work so heroku can deploy successfully</h4>
