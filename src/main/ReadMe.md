<h2>Wireframe and ERD Diagram</h2>

<h2>Initial Plan:</h2>
<p>The idea of being able to externally share your playlist of favorite videos was something I thought was a great start.
So I thought lets make a VidMe library. A hosted api site that saves your username and library of favorite URL's of videos from various sites.</p>

<h2>Sprint 1:</h2>
<h4>Get a Wireframe and ERD diagram proposed to follow up on initial start up of the fullstack project.</h4>

<h2>Sprint 2:</h2>
<h4>Set up backend to have dependencies and application properties set up properly.</h4>

<h2>Sprint 3:</h2>
<h4>Full operational Backend API that can add users, register new users, have users add to list with titles and url links, and be able to delete their items.</h4>

<h2>Sprint 4:</h2>
<h4>Implement edits and text changes to service and controller call for backend. Push backend to heroku for proper server usage.</h4>
